## Storyline
The Player is a water elemental being in an idyllic forest.
Hostile fire creatures threaten the forest, attempting to set it ablaze.
The forest  is engulfed in flames, and the player must find the source of the fire.
While searching for the source, ancient combat techniques from previous generations are discovered.
The player grows stronger by mastering these techniques.
The goal is to save the forest and overcome the fire threat.

## Character Design
We wanted a water character as the player to match the theme. At first, we had the idea of a jellyfish, but then it turned into a cute little water slime.

There are three different enemy types: Melee, Range, and Explosion (aka Creeper). These spawn all over the world to increase player interaction while traveling through our world. But to save the forest, the boss must also be defeated!
